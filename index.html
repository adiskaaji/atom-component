          My search for a methodology to craft interface design systems led me to look for inspiration in other fields and industries.
          Given this amazingly complex world we’ve created, it seemed only natural that other fields would have tackled similar problems
          we could learn from and appropriate. As it turns out, loads of other fields such as industrial design and architecture have
          developed smart modular systems for manufacturing immensely complex objects like airplanes, ships, and skyscrapers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But my original explorations kept creeping back to the natural world, which triggered memories of sitting at a rickety desk in
          my high school’s chemistry lab.
